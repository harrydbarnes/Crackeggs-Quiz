08/07/2021, 5:13 pm - Jack Chandler: None i started looking about half 4 as works been manic until then

Could we start booking pubs earlier in the day for close to the main areas but just outside so we have something definite in?

Then make our way inwards for the game?
08/07/2021, 5:14 pm - Jack Chandler: Ideally we want one of the main central zones but maybe should start thinking of back ups too
08/07/2021, 5:15 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: I would also be looking mate think we are all doing what we can lol
08/07/2021, 5:15 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Not an easy event to get seats for
08/07/2021, 5:16 pm - Harry Barnes: Nothing yet on ballot stuff. Boxpark said will email around mid-day Friday. Flat iron email by 11am Friday too
08/07/2021, 5:16 pm - Harry Barnes: Roundhouse pub in covent garden aren't taking bookings, could try go there for mid-day see if we can get a table
08/07/2021, 5:17 pm - Jack Chandler: If we have to be up there earlier than usual then so be it, means more drinking time😏
08/07/2021, 5:18 pm - Harry Barnes: Yeah I think if we don't go up early we'll struggle to get anywhere with current restrictions
08/07/2021, 5:19 pm - Jack Chandler: 100% agree earlier we’re up there the better
08/07/2021, 5:19 pm - Harry Barnes: Might even have to stay at first place tbh. If we can reserve then come back later, fine

13/07/2021, 5:54 pm - Jack Chandler: Saturday boys for georges birthday

2 Tables of 4 booked next to each other for shenfield tandoori for 8pm

I tried giggling squid and lemongrass but they were fully booked for the weekend
13/07/2021, 5:55 pm - Harry Barnes: Nice one!
13/07/2021, 5:55 pm - Harry Barnes: So weird, drove past there the other day thinking would be nice to go there 😏
17/07/2021, 9:26 am - Joe Churchill 🌱: Do we have two tables out together or is it two tables with one of those dividers in the middle?
17/07/2021, 9:27 am - Jack Chandler: Its two tables of 4 next to each other thats all he said but i don’t think shenfield tandoori would have them up no restaurants do its just pubs etc that do
17/07/2021, 9:27 am - Jack Chandler: I went there when restrictions first eased end of last year and there were no dividers up so we should be good
17/07/2021, 11:33 am - Joe Churchill 🌱: Was thinking, if meals at 8 then it won’t take long to finish so probably finish half 9? So what we doing after if anything? A little birdie told me that Jackie Chan has a free house today and all weekend so….
17/07/2021, 5:08 pm - Harry Barnes: Thoughts on getting some drinks in before at like 6:30/7? Either Hutton junction, Holland's or vine?
17/07/2021, 5:10 pm - Harry Barnes: Holland's as in the place, not inviting myself round aha
17/07/2021, 5:10 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Personally I will just meet you all at the curry house 👍
17/07/2021, 5:10 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: But does sound a shout
17/07/2021, 5:10 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: I am down for a couple larger tops before curry 😏
17/07/2021, 5:12 pm - Harry Barnes: It's a date then 😘
17/07/2021, 5:20 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: Got another option if it’s preferred but mums just text me saying she’s gone out and back about 10 so could have a few drinks round there beforehand?
17/07/2021, 5:20 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: If it sounds like a shout then why not come?
17/07/2021, 5:20 pm - Jack Chandler: Or welcome at mine too boys! I don’t mind whatever everyone else wants to do
17/07/2021, 5:21 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: That’s also an idea
17/07/2021, 5:22 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: Although from mine we can walk it to the place

17/07/2021, 5:23 pm - Harry Barnes: Just phoned junction and they said walk in only and should have space
17/07/2021, 5:24 pm - Harry Barnes: Even the lot outside actually might be alright
17/07/2021, 5:24 pm - Harry Barnes: I'm thinking pub. Can try high street if you want for the places we've said

21/02/2022, 2:47 pm - Jack Chandler: Afternoon boys! Me and curt were talking over the weekend and we’re thinking of getting a city break for a long weekend (4/5 days) sorted for the end of march or anytime in April if you boys would be up for it;

Few places we have mentioned;

1 dublin
2 barcelona
3 prague
4 budapest


But happy to go anywhere to be honest if theres anywhere else you boys really wanna go! Date wise whatever suits people best too is cool probably best we avoid easter though as will be more expensive due to schools on half term
21/02/2022, 2:50 pm - Harry Barnes: Dublin sounds fun, presuming not for Paddy's Day though which is 17th march, could be fun though but much more dollar
21/02/2022, 2:51 pm - Harry Barnes: Also I haven't been there before so that's probably my pick
21/02/2022, 2:51 pm - George Holland 🤪: Not sure I'm allowed to travel to any of these lol
21/02/2022, 2:51 pm - Jack Chandler: Dublin you can! I’m sure 😅

21/02/2022, 2:54 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: How hot would Barcelona be actually in March
21/02/2022, 2:55 pm - Harry Barnes: 17 max apparently
21/02/2022, 2:55 pm - Jack Chandler: These were my top two - Barcelona is about 15 in march and 20 in april

28/03/2022, 1:36 pm - Harry Barnes: My dad's taking me and Olli, then you boys have a taxi. Pickup at Joe first 6:45 then onto Tom, then George. Actually saved £20 on taxis I think!
28/03/2022, 1:36 pm - Harry Barnes: Spoke to Olli, as it's last min change and can't do anything, we'll spread that taxi for the 4 of you over me and Olli as well
30/03/2022, 11:09 am - Harry Barnes: Checked in lads. will send boarding passes to you individually
30/03/2022, 11:27 am - Harry Barnes: Sent. There's a note about covid documentation on boarding pass, but nothing technically is required.

However, if you want to send me a screenshot of your covid pass I will upload. I'd recommend doing a test also, particularly for George.

Facemasks are still required by ryanair.
30/03/2022, 11:27 am - Harry Barnes: I'm out at Cams graduation now but just quickly on rooms also:

Me and curt
Tom and Jack
Joe and Olli
George and 9 randos
30/03/2022, 5:06 pm - Harry Barnes: Evening team. Dublin tomorrow init.

Taxi is 6:45 from Joes flat, then onto Tom to pickup himself and Jack. Then it's onto George. He takes cash payment, as you've paid me already I'll sort cash with Tom tonight as we have a gig (shock)

Me and Olli are leaving via mine at 7, curt is getting train. I'd suggest when you get there to just go through security and we'll meet at Spoons.

Reminder that Ryanair bag is quite small so underpack a bit if you have a bigger bag. Mask needed, share covid pass if you want me to upload.

Shared room details already, hotel is Temple Bar Inn.

Guiness tour is 4:15 on Thursday, booked Doolaly indian at 7pm. Friday is pub golf curated by Thomas and then Saturday have little pyg pizza + cocktails at 8pm.

21/11/2022, 12:36 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Think it’s like brake stuff and fluid and senor
21/11/2022, 12:41 pm - Jack Chandler: £1100 you sure they’re not just taking the piss out of you?😅 thats a lot of money for a service
21/11/2022, 12:46 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: It is a shitty old banger though

21/11/2022, 12:49 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Nah you've got to service your car other than an MOT
21/11/2022, 12:50 pm - Harry Barnes: You don't have to, you can do the basic checks yourself that they'd otherwise charge you for
21/11/2022, 12:51 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: MOT is done every year to ensure your car legally meets road side  requirements

21/11/2022, 12:53 pm - Harry Barnes: Anyways you're probably glad it's been spotted even if it's cost a bomb
21/11/2022, 12:58 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: I mean could do with it being less but just a bullet I have to take

11/04/2023, 6:31 pm - Jack Chandler: People book their flights for the summer holidays like a year in advance we’re not that organised 🤣

11/04/2023, 7:21 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Only thing we could do is go like just before school break? But that would mean us sorting new dates etc
11/04/2023, 7:21 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: But again I will say this
11/04/2023, 7:22 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Budapest is just expensive now lol, and like all destinations have shot up in price
11/04/2023, 7:22 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Cost of Livy
11/04/2023, 7:23 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Idm changing to an earlier date if it means we skip the summer school holiday prices
11/04/2023, 7:23 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: The week before is like the 17th July right? Who can and can’t make that?
11/04/2023, 7:24 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: @⁨Curtis Denmark 🤓⁩ Do I remember you saying Airbnb's were ridiculously expensive too or did I dream that?
11/04/2023, 7:24 pm - Jack Chandler: Can’t make that! I’m on holiday already

11/04/2023, 7:31 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: <Media omitted>
11/04/2023, 7:32 pm - Harry Barnes: What about October, let me push the wedding back
11/04/2023, 7:32 pm - Harry Barnes: End of August is cheaper as well actually but idk if we can get everyone free for another week?
11/04/2023, 7:34 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Okay if I set up a poll for every week in summer, will people actually vote on all the days they can do? 😂
11/04/2023, 7:34 pm - Jack Chandler: This message was deleted
11/04/2023, 7:35 pm - Jack Chandler: Thats the thing are we actually gonna get everyone free for another week? If so happy to change, just july is just a no go for me as away for 20 days of it already
11/04/2023, 7:37 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Price is not gonna fluctuate to much from either month I think we are risking people not attending if we change dates
11/04/2023, 7:38 pm - Harry Barnes: Hasn't this already been done at some stage?
11/04/2023, 7:39 pm - Jack Chandler: Yeah curt originally done one how we decided the dates if i’m correct?
11/04/2023, 7:42 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: If we can get a much cheaper deal though I think it’s worth it
11/04/2023, 7:44 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: June flights are looking hella cheaper tho
11/04/2023, 7:48 pm - Harry Barnes: Not just about flights though, accomodation is bigger cost so price could come out similar
11/04/2023, 7:48 pm - Harry Barnes: This is the poll we did
11/04/2023, 8:06 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Well if we are changing it.. the poll is now invalid wouldn't we say?
11/04/2023, 8:08 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Poll is just for august dates as well I’m realising 👀
11/04/2023, 8:08 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Well I don't mind
11/04/2023, 8:08 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: I'm not happy paying £300 for flights but we always knew mid August would be like this
11/04/2023, 8:08 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: We can try and see if another date fits, if not we have one in the bag already
11/04/2023, 8:09 pm - Harry Barnes: Well it's not invalid is it but another poll for other dates gives more to play with
11/04/2023, 8:09 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Give me a min for this poll thing
11/04/2023, 8:09 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: I just mean they're all August, so all gonna be extortionate
11/04/2023, 8:09 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Gonna do for July and august each weekend
11/04/2023, 8:09 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Don’t purposely not vote the existing weekend also because it’s expensive lol
11/04/2023, 8:10 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: Put June in the poll Curt
11/04/2023, 8:10 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: When do I need to get this vote in for? I am on annual leave this week

05/06/2023, 6:44 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Just an idea as you will see the footy regardless where you are and can even see outside that’s how clear it is the screens

Bring your partners aswell the more the merrier! I might put a poll up abit later for some ideas but tbh just being in all of your company is special enough ☺️ - love you

So after all we've been though together this year I want to thank you all for your friendship and wish you a happy and fulfilling 2018 - you’re the best gymnastics group anyone could ask for.

Best wishes, Helen xxx🎄❤️

29/12/2023, 5:00 pm - Jack Chandler: Shall we say 6 at fleece? Thats what time we got their last year and managed to get a table etc
29/12/2023, 5:01 pm - Jack Chandler: And then meet at your mums before that?

Could uber like last year too as it probably works out cheaper than  everyone paying for the train

Think was like £20 for the uber to the fleece from hutton last year
29/12/2023, 5:04 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Ain’t there gonna be a bunch of us. Surely be way easier just hitching on a train?
29/12/2023, 5:06 pm - Jack Chandler: If theres only what 8 of us probably be easier getting the train the trains like a fiver each anyway by the time we walk to station from joes mums be easier/cheaper to get the uber
29/12/2023, 5:06 pm - Jack Chandler: But i’ll do whatever to the majority wanna do i’m not that fussed! Was just thinking whats easiest/cheapest from joes mums thats all <This message was edited>

02/01/2024, 1:53 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Really think I should have put my Polo up for more now haha
02/01/2024, 1:58 pm - Harry Barnes: It's the low mileage that's done it favours, a car this old would usually be run into the ground
02/01/2024, 1:58 pm - Harry Barnes: Guy buying it is gonna be doing 60 miles a day so by end of first week done more than I do in a year 😂
02/01/2024, 2:18 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Who buys a ka to drive it 60 miles a day that’s mad
02/01/2024, 2:21 pm - Jack Chandler: Will the car even make it 60 miles? 😂
02/01/2024, 2:21 pm - Harry Barnes: His other car is an Alfa with a big engine so he burns through money with it atm

03/01/2024, 3:08 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: We need to think about leave over summer if we wanted to do boys holibobs. Will need to submit annual leave over the summer holidays early if I am to get it in case of clashes. Gonna put a poll up on months to go away in and then we can break it down slowly from there if you have plans in the summer probably best to say ect so we can all avoid any date issues
03/01/2024, 3:11 pm - Jack Chandler: Probably be best to do june as be out of school holidays so be cheaper flights

Also if we wanna do villa holiday in summer that we have spoken about we’ll have to sort that pretty quickly as all the best/cost effective ones will be gone <This message was edited>

03/01/2024, 6:12 pm - Harry Barnes: 1,037% over 5
03/01/2024, 6:13 pm - Harry Barnes: Unless you have money to lose you wouldn't have a substantial amount in there in case it crashes significantly which can happen

03/01/2024, 6:15 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: I use crypto.com
03/01/2024, 6:16 pm - Harry Barnes: That's a lot to potentially lose or go down when you need it most though!
03/01/2024, 6:16 pm - Harry Barnes: Depends how much percentage of overall savings that is I guess
03/01/2024, 6:18 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Bitcoin is the least riskiest because it’s considered and stable coin because everyone dumps in bitcoin when it goes down to 10-14k but it really does have no real bearing
03/01/2024, 6:18 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: It’s not backed by anything it’s made up
03/01/2024, 6:19 pm - Harry Barnes: Yeah it's stable compared to us apart from when georgey boy needed it lol
03/01/2024, 6:19 pm - Harry Barnes: Other ones are a nightmare. I know a few who do it plus trading and they are consumed by it
03/01/2024, 6:21 pm - Jack Chandler: I’m surprised ryans allowed to trade working at the bank?
03/01/2024, 6:21 pm - Jack Chandler: But yeah its way too risky for me! As have 0 clue what i’m doing 😅 But i suppose if got a hefty amound saved can risk some <This message was edited>

05/01/2024, 2:22 pm - Harry Barnes: It's worth with villas in particular seeing if they'd accept booking outside of Airbnb, £450 for a few is extortionate
05/01/2024, 2:22 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: One week I can’t do great lol
05/01/2024, 2:22 pm - Harry Barnes: I think book then check dates, I can cross fingers and toes
05/01/2024, 2:23 pm - Harry Barnes: I'll be honest I ticked 2nd to give us an option but the third week in sept is much better for me <This message was edited>
05/01/2024, 2:23 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Ah shit soz lol yeah won’t pick that week then
05/01/2024, 2:24 pm - Harry Barnes: But I don't think jack can do that week, wb16th
05/01/2024, 2:24 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Ryan didn’t put that as an option because he can’t do it lol
05/01/2024, 2:24 pm - Jack Chandler: I can ask! But with certain people off already i’m just not 100% sure be approved with the ones i didn’t tick - but most should be fine
05/01/2024, 2:25 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Harry could try and change and do them June dates 👀 hehe
05/01/2024, 2:25 pm - Jack Chandler: To be fair i ticked september ones but would much rather june!

But i’m happy to go with what majority can do
05/01/2024, 2:26 pm - Harry Barnes: I mean wb 9th
05/01/2024, 2:28 pm - Jack Chandler: If this is the best date i can ask for it off! And see what they say

As not asked for leave at this job yet just dunno how many allowed off at same time thats all
05/01/2024, 2:28 pm - Harry Barnes: I can only do the one week I selected in June, can't change when gigs are played unfortunately
05/01/2024, 2:28 pm - Jack Chandler: So didn’t wanna tick as such and it not be a option
05/01/2024, 2:29 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Can everyone do June 29th to July 6th?
05/01/2024, 2:30 pm - Jack Chandler: Should be fine with me
05/01/2024, 2:31 pm - Jack Chandler: Ideally need tom to vote on dates asap or we know what’ll happen we’ll get a date agreed and he won’t be able to do that date and we’ll have to change it all😂
05/01/2024, 2:32 pm - Harry Barnes: I can't do the 29th but I can do rest so happy to fly out 30th

05/01/2024, 2:33 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Jack
05/01/2024, 2:33 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Curt is that an ok date?
05/01/2024, 2:34 pm - Harry Barnes: We could whack up in another online poll, not here, all dates in June/July/August so people can tick, then we pick best options - week 5 days or people fly out different dates
05/01/2024, 2:34 pm - Jack Chandler: Yeah it should be fine with me!

16/01/2024, 8:54 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: A lot of people trying to get similar periods of leave at the same time it seems
16/01/2024, 9:34 am - Jack Chandler: To be fair we need to get a move on re booking villas otherwise the good ones that are decent priced will be gone come the end of the month

You don’t pay for them now its a small deposit for most of them then pay full amount month or so before we go.

So if Tom’s not heard by the end of the week maybe we plan for 6 of us and if tom gets accepted at a later date we’ll just work costs out for 7 instead
16/01/2024, 9:56 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: Yeah you can crack on guys, don't let me stop you ☺️
16/01/2024, 10:58 am - Joe Churchill 🌱: If we book a villa for 6 then toms holiday gets accepted there won’t be enough beds right?
16/01/2024, 11:05 am - Jack Chandler: Most the villas i’ve seen will sleep 7

For example one ryan sent before was for 6 but had room 1 with 2 single beds, room 2 had queen bed, room 3 had queen bed and then a sofa bed so would sleep 7 if need be
16/01/2024, 11:05 am - Jack Chandler: So can make it work if need be but we can have a look later in the week
16/01/2024, 12:27 pm - Harry Barnes: Absolute worse case is you can book a hotel room nearby or something
16/01/2024, 12:27 pm - Harry Barnes: Like George doing a hostel when we went Dublin lol

17/04/2024, 6:29 pm - George Holland 🤪: Evening boys

Occurred to me the other week we never think to give Stock a go for a night. Bit of an older, posher crowd but at this stage I'd much rather than the usual demographic we get at The Crown or anywhere we normally end up

Gunna suggest a cosy one Friday night on the 26th where we eat at one of the pubs then I'll book us a table at another one to move on and get a few bevs down us

I'm thinking no 19 year olds, no chavs, no rail replacement bs and most importantly no Olli spending all night talking about his love life. Just good times and good company 🤗
17/04/2024, 6:30 pm - Jack Chandler: Yeah i’m free next Friday and i’d be up for giving stock a go!
17/04/2024, 6:31 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: I’m on earlys I can go
17/04/2024, 6:32 pm - Harry Barnes: Was expecting a joke at some stage
17/04/2024, 6:32 pm - Harry Barnes: I'm away that weekend but Stock is decent
17/04/2024, 6:32 pm - Harry Barnes: The Hoop is decent
17/04/2024, 6:33 pm - George Holland 🤪: Yeah that's where I'm thinking we should eat!
17/04/2024, 6:33 pm - George Holland 🤪: Ah shame bro
17/04/2024, 6:33 pm - George Holland 🤪: We'll send pictures
17/04/2024, 6:33 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: I agree with this
17/04/2024, 6:33 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: I’m down for that
17/04/2024, 6:34 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: But of a change in scenery
17/04/2024, 6:34 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: Bit*
17/04/2024, 6:34 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Oh yeah that pub we went to in lockdown that was 3 hours away ... great location 😉

17/04/2024, 6:53 pm - George Holland 🤪: Happy to go with any that shut at 11pm or later

Maisie's got a free house on 27th July, so thought we could have a proper day sesh round here as she's got a class garden for it and the weather should be 🔥 can either have a BBQ or get a takeaway

But yeah pizza’s a no go for me but if others want that I can just order separately no biggy <This message was edited>
22/07/2024, 11:53 am - George Holland 🤪: BBQ it is then 💦

So how I'm thinking of doing it, if I buy the food for everyone including big crates of:

- Corona
- Estrella
- Birra Morreti
- Camden Hells
- + mixers

So all of us are covered (minus Jack, apologies) and you boys just have to rock up in your disco shoes.

Lemme know if this sounds like a plan and I'll get a pre order locked in with the butchers

Reckon all in all everything should come to about £120 so if you could transfer £15 each I can sort everything 🙏 (obvs girlfriends don't need to pay anything)

@⁨Jack Chandler⁩ as you won't be drinking the beers, you'd only need to send a tenner
22/07/2024, 12:02 pm - George Holland 🤪: And obviously if anyone wants me to tweak the beers I'm buying, just hola

28/07/2024, 9:25 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Boooooooys,
As I've said to most of you already, Hanna and I are going to be having a joint party at her place (51 Aldborough Road South, IG3 8HP) on 25th August.

Still working out food, drinks and other bits but thinking £10 each should cover it if that's okay with all of you 😊😊 I'll get some beers in as well as plenty of mixer.

Arrival at 3/4 ish would be good! Feel free to bring any games/let me know if you have any ideas. Traitors was amazing so it will be difficult to not incorporate that into the evening.

28/02/2025, 9:54 am - George Holland 🤪: What's better: 1st half of the year Vs 2nd half
28/02/2025, 9:54 am - George Holland 🤪: So like
28/02/2025, 9:55 am - George Holland 🤪: Jan to June
28/02/2025, 9:55 am - Jack Chandler: 2nd half not even close get best of summer and christmas
28/02/2025, 9:55 am - George Holland 🤪: Vs July to December
28/02/2025, 9:55 am - Jack Chandler: Jan-feb probably most depressing months of the year
28/02/2025, 9:56 am - George Holland 🤪: Ah man I thought that at first then decided the other way
28/02/2025, 9:56 am - George Holland 🤪: Cos with the spring months you know summers coming
28/02/2025, 9:56 am - George Holland 🤪: Like best of the year is yet to come
28/02/2025, 9:56 am - George Holland 🤪: Whereas 2nd half you gotta accept it's going to be months before you see some sun again once you get to October
28/02/2025, 9:58 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: First half better I agree
28/02/2025, 9:58 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Oct Nov Dec has the shittest weather
28/02/2025, 9:58 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Rainy and dark
28/02/2025, 10:00 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: On paper it's second half
28/02/2025, 10:00 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: But that first half... it fills you with optimism of what's to come doesn't it
28/02/2025, 10:00 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: What a shower dilemma
28/02/2025, 10:00 am - Jack Chandler: Great shower thought tbf
28/02/2025, 10:00 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: The other thought was, wow I can't get over how big my balls are!!
28/02/2025, 10:01 am - George Holland 🤪: Yeah it's this. Once that first mildly sunny week hits in march or whatever
28/02/2025, 10:02 am - George Holland 🤪: Its like best time of the year cos got the best months ahead of you

28/02/2025, 10:06 am - George Holland 🤪: Whereas 2nd half of the year at some point in September you know it's all downhill until December
28/02/2025, 10:11 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: But do you though? Because England keeps you on its toes with the weather and gives you like a week of sun to keep you going then back to overcast.

03/03/2025, 8:13 pm - Joe Churchill 🌱: Sorry guys was still debating what to do lol plan is Clays in Canary Wharf at 2 as I couldn’t get a slot for the city, so meet up about 1ish beforehand. Then head soho way as there’s a couple places that do good Guinness apparently, then probs 5:30ish for a meal, drink or two after maybe depending and then Bounce in Farringdon at 8:30. Cheaper birthday hopefully… Clays is £12, Bounce is £8. Haven’t decided where to eat yet and pretty easy going so open to any recommendations for around Soho/holborn area if anyone knows of any nice places? Found a place called Balans No.60, small place, no idea what it’s like but there’s a pork belly on the menu that’s looking tasty, Italian could be good although they look quite fancy and pricy, or we go for a steak again which I wouldn’t mind. I’ll chuck in a poll and go with that

12/05/2025, 12:15 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Is gonna be a casual one Harry man. Don’t think anyone’s planning on staying out super late. And you’re gonna be going through shenners on way home from work too 😏
12/05/2025, 3:04 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: I'd prefer Shenfield selfishly, so I can watch the United Chelsea game. Love seeing my team lose ☺️
12/05/2025, 3:18 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Yeah shenfield is the plan I think now. Meet at Junction for 5? 🤔
13/05/2025, 9:52 pm - George Holland 🤪: If I can pick shenny station boys up would you consider green man?

I voted for Shenfield pubs initially but Junction and Dragon are so shit and chavy
13/05/2025, 9:53 pm - George Holland 🤪: Basically choosing between staring at Sam Dawes' fat face or Charlie Frain's
13/05/2025, 9:53 pm - George Holland 🤪: With those
13/05/2025, 9:54 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Green man has got a cute little beer garden atm too tbf
13/05/2025, 9:54 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: I’m down. If I can be one of the shenny boys getting picked up at shenners lol
13/05/2025, 9:55 pm - George Holland 🤪: Yeah ofc lol
13/05/2025, 9:56 pm - George Holland 🤪: Green Man's beer garden is 1000x the vibe of the others
13/05/2025, 9:57 pm - Jack Chandler: Green man cool with me!
13/05/2025, 9:58 pm - George Holland 🤪: Also I can drop shenners boys back home
13/05/2025, 9:58 pm - George Holland 🤪: / at station before train home
13/05/2025, 10:30 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Gonna be such a pain lol, but would be much easier for me being nearer a station for getting home and that
13/05/2025, 10:30 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Another alternative
13/05/2025, 10:31 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: What’s that inn on the greens beer garden like lol
13/05/2025, 10:31 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Could go there? But if green man is the preferred no issues
13/05/2025, 10:31 pm - George Holland 🤪: Even if I pick you up and drop you off tho?
13/05/2025, 10:32 pm - George Holland 🤪: Already sounds like I'm doing it for a couple of the boys
13/05/2025, 10:32 pm - George Holland 🤪: And yeah not bad
13/05/2025, 10:32 pm - Jack Chandler: Inn on the green beer garden is alright but its no better than junction in terms of chavs
13/05/2025, 10:36 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Was just thinking in case I need to duck off to get my train don’t want to cut rest of yours boys nights short
13/05/2025, 10:39 pm - George Holland 🤪: What times your train?
13/05/2025, 10:41 pm - George Holland 🤪: Jack's driving too if you don't trust me to take you back

13/05/2025, 11:11 pm - Harry Barnes: Gonna DM my man Charlie to go green man now
14/05/2025, 6:56 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: George clearly has part ownership of the Green Man (it is better).

I'm not massively fussed I guess, as the game doesn't mean too much but would still ideally like to watch it. Green Dragon also has screens outside, plus Charlie Frain wouldn't dare sit out in that heat, he'd melt into a puddle of sweat and bacon fat 🥓 💦 <This message was edited>
14/05/2025, 8:50 am - George Holland 🤪: Lol I don't really mind either tbf I just hate the clientele at those places <This message was edited>

10/07/2025, 11:33 am - George Holland 🤪: Question for the gamers.

How long until AI ruins online gaming? Surely we can't be far off screen readers that auto aim for you etc
10/07/2025, 11:33 am - George Holland 🤪: Or even botting in a way that the gaming companies can't pick up
10/07/2025, 11:56 am - Harry Barnes: Already been happening in warzone and others for years now on PC
10/07/2025, 11:59 am - Ryan Kavanagh: So aim bot already exists but anti cheat software try’s to counter auto aiming already
10/07/2025, 12:00 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Surely the ever evolving nature of AI will come out on top over any software created long term?
10/07/2025, 12:00 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: AI will be perfect precision for any game because AI lacks conscious so software can detect perfect ticks and rhythms in accuracy
10/07/2025, 12:00 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Human touch is suppose to not be perfect so software can detect that
10/07/2025, 12:00 pm - Jack Chandler: My thing is why play a game if gonna aim bot etc surely defeats purpose of playing

(Unless competitions for money then makes sense)
10/07/2025, 12:00 pm - Jack Chandler: Like wheres the fun in that kinda?
10/07/2025, 12:01 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: https://youtu.be/6l3HneL1WTk?si=J2vXzbmx4WnjdBw8

I’d like to see AI spend all day killing sandcrabs
10/07/2025, 12:01 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Cos people like to cheat and don’t find gratification in actually achieving things legitimately sadly
10/07/2025, 12:02 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: AI will also improve single player games eventually, better npcs and shit in gta
10/07/2025, 12:02 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Only thing it would be good for eyy
10/07/2025, 12:04 pm - George Holland 🤪: I agree but you know they'll be tonnes of people rinsing software like that
10/07/2025, 12:04 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: AI would be good for this stuff AI isn’t all bad but the moment you introduce it into human controls it can end badly that’s the line society needs to learn not to cross lol
10/07/2025, 12:04 pm - George Holland 🤪: Could you not instruct the AI to make the occasional error tho to remain undetected?
10/07/2025, 12:04 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: AI is gonna be good for colonising mars you know
10/07/2025, 12:05 pm - Harry Barnes: Already does
10/07/2025, 12:05 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: I've read a few things about the new GTA that npcs change their actions/speech/story arch slightly depending on your decisions in game. That may not be that special but sounded pretty good to me.
10/07/2025, 12:05 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Yeah but you need to code a specif script and it will eventually cause a pattern so you can eventually detect
10/07/2025, 12:05 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Theoretically
10/07/2025, 12:07 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: If you really deep AI and the space race we ain’t gonna send millions of people to mars you would send robots no? Think about the push for renewable energy? Can’t be using fossil fuels when developing mars ect
10/07/2025, 12:07 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: All makes sense for the bigger picture imo
10/07/2025, 12:07 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: Not saying we should go to mars but that’s what the billionaires are pioneering for
10/07/2025, 12:08 pm - George Holland 🤪: Gone from talking about auto aim on video games to colonising Mars just like that
10/07/2025, 12:08 pm - George Holland 🤪: Love it lol
10/07/2025, 12:08 pm - Ryan Kavanagh: 😂
10/07/2025, 12:08 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Surely AI will end up almost forming the code itself so that it's pattern free and very difficult to detect
10/07/2025, 12:09 pm - Jack Chandler: Like we’ve all been smoking the devils lettuce kinda convo
10/07/2025, 12:10 pm - George Holland 🤪: That's the thing. It can perpetually rewrite itself and the patterns it will use
10/07/2025, 12:10 pm - George Holland 🤪: So therefore how do you detect it?
10/07/2025, 12:10 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: AI at the moment is almost a 'hallucination of the truth', just an amalgamation of information collated. This will no doubt develop further to being able to collate its own information if you get what I mean.
10/07/2025, 12:13 pm - George Holland 🤪: I think it will get scary when they start mass releasing AI software operating computer interfaces by itself to do tasks and stuff <This message was edited>

11/11/2025, 2:14 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Nah they're uncomfortable as fuck. Just borrow someone's running shorts

11/11/2025, 2:16 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Nah

11/11/2025, 2:17 pm - Curtis Denmark 🤓: 400m tracks
11/11/2025, 2:17 pm - George Holland 🤪: Where could we hire out a track?
11/11/2025, 2:17 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: It’s not like a line where there’s a starting pistol and you go. It’s just easier if you record on strava
11/11/2025, 2:17 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Again, you literally will be the only person not doing it there lol?
11/11/2025, 2:18 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Is there one at king George’s?
11/11/2025, 2:19 pm - George Holland 🤪: I don't care about my time
11/11/2025, 2:19 pm - George Holland 🤪: I just care about if I get to the finish line before you
11/11/2025, 2:19 pm - George Holland 🤪: And that's all that matters for this bet
11/11/2025, 2:20 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: You don't need to hire a running track for this bet ffs 😂
11/11/2025, 2:21 pm - George Holland 🤪: Ikr

The Weald
11/11/2025, 2:28 pm - George Holland 🤪: Your pick
11/11/2025, 2:28 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: 22nd November
11/11/2025, 2:28 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: 9am
11/11/2025, 2:28 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Be there
11/11/2025, 2:28 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Or be
11/11/2025, 2:28 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: 🥚
11/11/2025, 2:36 pm - George Holland 🤪: Before we shake

We need to both agree in front of everyone that the 22nd Nov @ 9am is final

If someone doesn't show up or flakes at the last minute cos they were up until 3am on Reddit, they automatically lose and therefore accept the forfeit
11/11/2025, 2:36 pm - George Holland 🤪: 🤝 ?
11/11/2025, 2:38 pm - George Holland 🤪: There can be no excuses
11/11/2025, 2:40 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: I’m prepared to shake on this. Providing the below

-I also want it on record tha the excuse watching David Icke conspiracy videos to 4am is also not an excuse
-we are doing it on the 22nd Nov for the fun run. So we are running at the event. Not ourselves
-We have a ruling on whether you have to use strava. I’ll accept you don’t have to use strava if that’s the majority consensus of the group
11/11/2025, 2:44 pm - Jack Chandler: I’d say no strava is fair if doing same run no need
11/11/2025, 2:49 pm - George Holland 🤪: Agree to all your terms aside from the Strava recording

I'm not gunna buy one of those strap things and I haven't got a watch
11/11/2025, 2:49 pm - George Holland 🤪: So I guess either we get majority ruling for no Strava
11/11/2025, 2:49 pm - George Holland 🤪: Or you drop that condition
11/11/2025, 2:50 pm - George Holland 🤪: Then we can go full steam ahead 🚂
11/11/2025, 2:50 pm - Olli Ansell 🤪: Sounds good to me

22/11/2025, 9:01 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: And getting in my running gear
22/11/2025, 9:01 am - George Holland 🤪: If Olli suddenly appears when the race starts
22/11/2025, 9:01 am - George Holland 🤪: Hiding in his car into the whistle goes
22/11/2025, 9:01 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: I asked for a lift. You said nah
22/11/2025, 9:05 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: So you lose the bet then
22/11/2025, 9:05 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: 🥚

22/11/2025, 9:15 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Not really. By the time I got an uber back (so like £40 there and back) It’d be past 10am
22/11/2025, 9:16 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Not really got a lot of choice with this one

22/11/2025, 9:47 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Unreal
22/11/2025, 9:47 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Olli could go for a 5k run today and see what time he gets for a laugh
22/11/2025, 9:48 am - George Holland 🤪: Excellent point
22/11/2025, 9:48 am - George Holland 🤪: Or should I say

22/11/2025, 10:01 am - Harry Barnes: Nice one doing it though mate
22/11/2025, 10:02 am - Ryan Kavanagh: If you set a time and date he’s car might break down again 👀 😂
22/11/2025, 10:05 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Ffs 😂 I’d rather be racing George than dealing with a broken car
22/11/2025, 10:06 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: So why didn’t you just do the uber there?
22/11/2025, 10:06 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: And sort car tomorrow or later on
22/11/2025, 10:07 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: ⬆️
22/11/2025, 10:07 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: You’re pretending that’s not a reason <This message was edited>
22/11/2025, 10:08 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: No way would it be £40
22/11/2025, 10:08 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Just making excuses now man I think
22/11/2025, 10:09 am - George Holland 🤪: 👊
22/11/2025, 10:09 am - George Holland 🤪: 😂

22/11/2025, 10:12 am - George Holland 🤪: On the terms
22/11/2025, 10:12 am - George Holland 🤪: That there could be no excuses
22/11/2025, 10:12 am - George Holland 🤪: £40 to avoid 12 XL eggs being launched at your face in -1 degrees?
22/11/2025, 10:13 am - George Holland 🤪: Bargain
22/11/2025, 10:14 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Not if it means not being in to sort my car
22/11/2025, 10:16 am - George Holland 🤪: So you can't go for a run and make a phone call to a garage in the same morning?
22/11/2025, 10:16 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: ?
22/11/2025, 10:17 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: I have to be where the car is
22/11/2025, 10:17 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: They can turn up any minute
22/11/2025, 10:17 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Could have been booked little later or tomorrow
22/11/2025, 10:17 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Or Monday
22/11/2025, 10:17 am - Harry Barnes: But you called for them right, surely do it after if you wanted to get Uber
22/11/2025, 10:17 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: You wfh like 5 days a week
22/11/2025, 10:18 am - Harry Barnes: Anyway, congrats to George for running and for meeting the rules of engagement 🤝

22/11/2025, 10:19 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Need the car for Monday
22/11/2025, 10:20 am - Curtis Denmark 🤓: Hm
22/11/2025, 10:23 am - Harry Barnes: Yeah that's fair if so
22/11/2025, 10:23 am - Harry Barnes: Rotten luck
22/11/2025, 10:23 am - Harry Barnes: Not as rotten as the eggs though I've got
22/11/2025, 10:25 am - George Holland 🤪: Noone at home to give the guy your car keys if they came?
22/11/2025, 10:26 am - George Holland 🤪: Not exactly fixing the problem with him ?
22/11/2025, 10:26 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Nope everyone’s out
22/11/2025, 10:26 am - George Holland 🤪: Convenient
22/11/2025, 10:26 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Not really
22/11/2025, 10:26 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: None of this is convenient 😂
22/11/2025, 10:27 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: I’d rather be running in a cold field than having to pay whatever to fix my car

22/11/2025, 10:40 am - George Holland 🤪: Especially with your run times
22/11/2025, 10:43 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: You finished 9:43 and my run time wouldn’t be much quicker then you. Gotta order an uber then get back. I wouldn’t be back before 10am
22/11/2025, 11:08 am - Harry Barnes: https://www.parkrun.org.uk/brentwood/results/latestresults/

Further proof in the pudding
22/11/2025, 11:14 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Why’s the time say 35 mins? 🤨
22/11/2025, 11:16 am - Tom Saunders 🐦: Chip time and gun time.

You know the score
22/11/2025, 11:19 am - George Holland 🤪: Gunna sound like a lie but there was a big queue to get your code scanned
22/11/2025, 11:19 am - George Holland 🤪: I timed it on my phone
22/11/2025, 11:22 am - George Holland 🤪: You probably would have finished about 9:35
22/11/2025, 11:22 am - George Holland 🤪: Id say that's time to get back home
22/11/2025, 11:22 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: I was not rushing for an Uber to get home
22/11/2025, 11:22 am - George Holland 🤪: Either way don't matter
22/11/2025, 11:23 am - George Holland 🤪: You're getting egg'd son
22/11/2025, 11:23 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Nah. Rematch
22/11/2025, 11:23 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: My excuse is valid
22/11/2025, 11:24 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: We had it against someone not turning up from sleeping in or something else
22/11/2025, 11:24 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: I was awake at that time. Just literally couldn’t go
22/11/2025, 11:24 am - George Holland 🤪: You're actually pathetic
22/11/2025, 11:25 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: There was no way I was going to be able to be there?
22/11/2025, 11:26 am - George Holland 🤪: <Media omitted>
22/11/2025, 11:26 am - George Holland 🤪: Explicitly says there can be no excuses
22/11/2025, 11:27 am - George Holland 🤪: And you agreed
22/11/2025, 11:27 am - George Holland 🤪: Shouldn't have shaken on it then
22/11/2025, 11:27 am - George Holland 🤪: Just take the egging bro you deserve it for so many reasons
22/11/2025, 11:28 am - George Holland 🤪: Not being funny you get some control over what times the mechanics give you
22/11/2025, 11:28 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: For having my car breakdown?
22/11/2025, 11:28 am - George Holland 🤪: And you knew you were busy
22/11/2025, 11:28 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: I had no way to get there either
22/11/2025, 11:28 am - George Holland 🤪: And made the decision to get your car fixed quicker
22/11/2025, 11:28 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: I asked you for a lift
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - George Holland 🤪: Rather than run the race
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: You said no <This message was edited>
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - George Holland 🤪: Hang on
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - George Holland 🤪: How would this have worked then if you couldn't have possible made it timing wise anyway
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - George Holland 🤪: And as I told you
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - George Holland 🤪: There was genuinely no room in the car
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: That seems hard to believe
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - George Holland 🤪: I met up with fam for a walk after the race
22/11/2025, 11:29 am - Olli Ansell 🤪: Awfully convenient
22/11/2025, 11:30 am - George Holland 🤪: <Media omitted>
22/11/2025, 11:30 am - George Holland 🤪: There's your proof

30/11/2025, 7:53 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: So the quiz for 6 of us? It's £38 for 90 mins each. If that's too steep obviously I get it and we can just do meal and drinks...
30/11/2025, 8:00 pm - Harry Barnes: Not amazing pricing that but not horrendous, happy to go with crowd on this
30/11/2025, 8:00 pm - Harry Barnes: Something like flight club, roughly half that price, could be fun
30/11/2025, 8:01 pm - Harry Barnes: Or for similar price there's an escape room in an actual disused station in south Kensington I believe, mentioned it yonks ago I think 👀
30/11/2025, 8:02 pm - Tom Saunders 🐦: Annoyingly if we had one more it would be cheaper pp
