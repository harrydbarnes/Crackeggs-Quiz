Then head soho way as there\u2019s a couple places that do good Guinness apparently, then probs 5:30ish for a meal, drink or two after maybe depending and then Bounce in Farringdon at 8:30. Cheaper birthday hopefully\u2026 Clays is \u00a312, Bounce is \u00a38. Haven\u2019t decided where to eat yet and pretty easy going so open to any recommendations for around Soho/holborn area if anyone knows of any nice places? Found a place called Balans No.60, small place, no idea what it\u2019s like but there\u2019s a pork belly on the menu that\u2019s looking tasty, Italian could be good although they look quite fancy and pricy, or we go for a steak again which I wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll chuck in a poll and go with that"
